API defs:
json reply format
In all cases, 405, 500, and 501 are possible replies.

GET /api/1/list
Replies with array of folders
Codes: 200

GET /api/1/list/:fldr:
Replies with array of images in formats specified by request's Accept
Should the server have a default Accept if the client does not provide one? If not reply with 416.
Codes: 200, 404, 416

GET /:fldr:/:img:
Replies with image data, regardless of Accept
Should specify type of data in headers
Codes: 200, 304, 308, 404
404 could mean file or folder doesn't exist

DELETE /:fldr:/:img:
Sends to trash if this is not the trash.
Should I allow trash single deletion? Probably not.
Should deleting a non-existing resource be allowed?
404 if folder doesn't exist, 204 if file doesn't exist.
Codes: 204, 404

POST /:fldr:/:img:
Body: :fldr2:
Moves :img: to fldr2.
On success, leave new path in Link as this may differ.
Server may temporarily "remember" this move and send 308 to any requesting clients.
Codes: 201, 400, 404, 411

DELETE /:fldr:
Deletes the folder if it is empty.
If it is not empty, server should send 412.
Codes: 204, 404, 412

GET /api/1/dedup/:fldr:[?token=...]
Replies with array of pairs of strings.
Each pair is believed to be a duplicate.
If this will take time to process, a continuance token will be returned with 202.
Making the request again with a query will try to look up the operation associated with the token.
200 if done, 202 if not done, 500 if failed.
Once the "done" result is sent, it is erased from the server's memory.
A request with a non-existent token will get 400.
Codes: 200, 202, 400, 404

GET /api/1/dedup
Like the previous one, but for all folders.
Returned strings will contain path separators.
The server may choose to arrange the array so that Sort images are always second when possible.
Codes: 200

GET /api/1/info/:fldr:
Mainly returns if the folder exists or not.
I might also add the size of the folder and how many items it contains.
The result of /:fldr: may be less than this number of items.
Codes: 204, 404

GET /api/1/info/:fldr:/:img:
Returns size and dimensions?
Codes: 200, 404, 410

PUT /api/1/info Body: rsc1,rsc2... url-encoded
Returns array of info objects, one for each item.
Unsure how to handle errors here. Maybe this endpoint is a bad idea?
Codes: 200, 404, 411

GET /api/1/settings
PUT /api/1/settings
Self-explanatory. Only settings defined by the PUT will be modified.
If the PUT contains unrecognized fields, 422 will be sent.
Codes: 200, 204, 411, 422
